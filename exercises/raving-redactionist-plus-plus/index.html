You don't have gloves on. <span class="top-secret redacted">Your finger's not on the trigger</span> and there are no bullets in the cylinder. You're right. I'm <span class="top-secret redacted">a lousy practical joker</span>. What are you doing here with that thing anyway? I was on my way down to the cabin, I thought I could use it for <span class="top-secret redacted">protection</span> down there. I also came by to apologize.
        </p>

        <p>
          For what? For <span class="top-secret redacted">blowing my cork the other day</span>. I got out of line. Forget it. That happens. No, it shouldn't happen. Not between you and me. So, believe it or not, sir...this is <span class="top-secret redacted">a peace pipe</span>. Bottoms up, Jim. <span class="top-secret redacted">In the middle of the morning? Oh, come on, relax. It's Saturday. In the mystery writer's soul,it is always the middle of the night</span>. A toast! Dear sir. I give you......<span class="top-secret redacted">our divorce. Well...it's not really a divorce</span>. Oh, sure it is. Come on, let's be honest. I mean, it...

Fifty million copies. To the lady who made it all possible</span>, the greatest sleuth in the world Mrs.Melville. Whom we brought to life and now we're about to bury. Come on, Ken. You're making me feel guilty. All I want to do is write on my own. <span class="top-secret redacted">You're right. I am being selfish. OK, my boy, my blessings On your solo flight. Thanks. I appreciate it. After all, friendship is more important than partnership, right? Here's to our friendship. Right. And now sir</span>, I'm going to kidnap you. What? The aforementioned cabin, which has been......finished for over six months now You haven't seen it. You're going to be my first male guest. <span class="top-secret redacted">I can't, Ken. Not now.

Oh, that's easy.
