# Intergalactic Pawn Shop Simulator
Artist Statement:
I began this project with the main priority to fix the problems I had with previous projects and use what I learned in both CART 263 and CART 253.
With these problems mainly being the use of arrays instead of repetitive and long code.
With that said, the project overall, has not changed to significantly since my original proposal.
I wanted to create an interactive dialogue based game that was reminiscent of some of my favourite games like Fallout 1 and 2 with their “talking heads” systems, and give the user the idea that they may be interacting with something relatively intelligent.
While I was not able to finish the selling aspect of my game, I believe the main aspects of what I wanted to do was completed and the game functions as a limited pawn shop simulator.
I enjoyed experimenting during this project, especially for designing the clients and writing the code for the dialogue trees, and I also believe the fun I had in making it comes across to the user/player.
Attached to this project is a companion guide I made to go alongside the game, in my dream version the player would need to consult this guide more so than now in the current version to both buy and sell items at appropriate values.
Additionally, I have made a brief and “fake” trailer (quotations because I would like to continue working on this game to a point similar to that of this trailer) which I have linked at the end of this artist statement.
This trailer displays what I would have liked the game to have looked like and function like (though much of the functions shown in the video are in the current build).

- I would like to thank both Pippin and Sharon for being so helpful and amazing when it came to not only making this project but in the entire 263 and 253 classes.
- I wish you both an excellent summer and future if I do not see you again.
