# A Night At The Movies

My work for this project first began by picking a movie I enjoy and then brainstorming a game that words off of some of the principles of the film.
The first film I thought of and started experimenting/brainstorming with in the form of written notes (and not actual code) was Akira Kurosawa’s 1955 Japanese film “Seven Samurai”, an epic samurai drama film that tells the story of a village on the verge of being raided by a group of roaming bandits who seek out seven samurai to hire for protection against these bandits under the promise/payment of rice.
My first brainstormed game idea is ultimately what my submission ended up being (although far more simplified than I initially imagined), you play as a samurai cutting down enemies with your katana.
Though when doing the “bubble popper plus plus” exercise I did not experience the same issues as a handful of students outlined as having during the first and or second in person class, when I started to experiment with a copy of the code to make my game these issues started to arise.
These issues including loading errors, camera issues, frame-rate drops, moments where the sound and video did not line up, etc.
Due to these issues, I switched my idea for my project to be a rhythm game using the project file for the “juggle garden” exercise from CART-253 and the 1965 musical drama film film “The Sound of Music” as the film based inspiration (with the idea being to use the songs from the film as the music/beats for the game).
Thanks to another wave of errors followed by the creation of this version of the project, I gave up and returned to my original idea of a sort of Fruit Ninja inspired game based loosely on “Seven Samurai”.
A few of the major issues I faced when making this project were as followed:

-   I could not figure out how to make the index finger instead be displayed as a pixel art based sword
-   I could not get certain .wav sounds to play despite there being to visible errors when I tested the game in browser and viewed the javascript console
-   My keyboard got destroyed (spilt water) during the process of making it, which really added to the time in making it
    Hopefully the end product is still fun to play to most people and still gives off the idea that you are a samurai either training or actively in battle.
